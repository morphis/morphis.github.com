    <div class="content">
      <p>After a long time I got finally supported by <a href="http://www.hp.com/">HP</a> (you know they bought
Palm and webOS back in 2010) with a <a href="http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/webos/us/en/veer.html">HP Veer</a> device for development.
Back in feburary 2011 HP started a Free Pre 2 Device program and I wrote
to them to get qualified for a device. After more than 8 months I finally
got a device (not the Pre 2 but who cares). The HP Veer is a very tiny
device I like very much. It has 2.6-inc display (take your wallet out and
look at your credit card, thats the size of the HP Veer), a powerfull
MSM chipset inside and all features you know from todays smartphones.</p>
<p>I will use the HP Veer mainly to create a open source implementation of
the RPC protocol used by all MSM chipsets to communicate with the baseband
chip. Already before I received the device I started with a library called
libmsmrpc which implements the basic functionality to to the RPC calls.
Today it's already possible to connect to the device and send commands to
the modem with the OEM RAPI service and receive response. Just the details
of the messages send to the device and received from the device needs to be
implemented. About the details of this and the current state I will write
something in the near future.</p>
