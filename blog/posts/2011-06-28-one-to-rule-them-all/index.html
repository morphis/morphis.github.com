      <p>Talking about modem processors used in todays smartphones is a sad story.
Most of them are using a binary protocol which is not known by the public.
In some cases the linux userland is talking plain AT over a serial line
with the modem but that's expected. Let me list some devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Palm Pre/Pre Pus/Pre 2: All three have a MSM6280 modem chip and are
using a binary protocol for modem access from the application processor.</li>
<li>Nokia N900: Uses a modem chip made by nokia with can be accessed with the
ISI protocol. Some parts of it are documented but not everything.
Furthermore the Linux support from Nokia is dieing with there move
to phones powered by Windows Mobile.</li>
<li>Google Nexus One/S: Both devices have a msm modem chip and are using
plain AT commands over a shared memory interface</li>
<li>Geeksphone: Is build on Qualcomms MSM platform and is using a binary
RPC protocol to communicate with the modem.</li>
<li>HP Veer: Is also build on Qualcomms MSM platform and is using the same
RPC protocol than the Geeksphone but in another way. They are sending
mostly the same packages as they did with the Palm Pre/Pre Plus/Pre 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I hope you get the point that there is not one way to communicate with a
modem in todays smartphones. This makes it a very complicated for a FOSS
operating system to be able to run on such a device. Also another problem
is when two devices are using the same way there are even differences
especially all devices using a msm modem chip. Qualcomm is offering a
toolset to smartphone creators, which makes it possible to customize
most bits of the modem part of the device even the protocol to communicate
with modem â€¦ For example between the different webOS versions of the
Palm Pre devices Palm changed some bits in the protocol so we have to adjust
our protocol implementation as well (which means some more days of reverse
engineering).</p>
<p>Especially for the smartphones using a MSM modem chip I am going to fix the
communication part for open source software. There should be a open and free
distributable implementation available people can use to talk to the modem
and do things they want to do. I cannot talk about concrete details yet,
but will post here when I can ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
