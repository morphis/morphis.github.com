      <p>Today I upgrade my server finally from Debian lenny to squeeze (which was
released already last year, but I never had the time to do the upgrade
since today). All in all the upgrade process went very fine. Following the
release upgrade notes helped a lot and saved me some time (see <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html">0</a>).</p>
<p>Finally I migrated to a dependency based boot system too. I already started
with this last year but stopped it a second time cause of missing time for
it. I purged today all packages I never purged which leave their stuff in
the init system after removal and the upgrade process succeeded finally.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all Debian people out here. You do a great job everyday!
Thank you very much, you saved me a lot time with focussing on quality and
stability.</p>
<p>As next step I will migrate the whole lighttpd migration back to apache2 as
I never felt very comfortable with lighttpd due to a lot of small things I
will not list here but maybe another time. Let's see how much time
there will be in the next weeks for it ðŸ™‚</p>
