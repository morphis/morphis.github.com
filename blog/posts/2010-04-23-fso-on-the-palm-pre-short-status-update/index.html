    <h1 class="title">FSO on the Palm Pre â€“ Short Status Update</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle is-5">April 23, 2010 by Simon Fels</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>For a long time we're now hacking on the Palm Pre device to get FSO
working: Time for a short summary were we are and what has do be done
in the near future (mickey <a href="http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-userland/2010-April/002539.html">already pointed out</a> which components are
working and which not).</p>
<p><strong>Modem</strong></p>
<p>The modem was the big show stopper when we initial began with hacking
on the Palm Pre. The protocol Palm uses to communicate with the modem
is nothing already known in the FOSS community. Yes, there is even an
AT-Port you can use but there are missing some commands we need to make
calls or register for so called <em>unsolicited responses</em>. Â So the only
way to bring FSO to the Palm Pre was to reverse engineering the protocol.</p>
<p>Most of the basic reverse engineering is done. We know how the protocol
works and how we can use it. We wrote an implementation of the protocol
and it is used in FSO's fsogsmd to interact with the modem (checkout
msmcommd and libmsmcomm in the <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=msmcomm.git;a=summary">msmcomm repository</a>). We can make
calls and see when a call is comming in.</p>
<p>Currently we are using both ports (the AT and the binary one) to
communicate with the modem. So we have all functionality you want have
to on a basic phone (Call, SMS, &hellip;) but no GPRS/EDGE/HSDPA connection.
Normally webOS uses the AT port to setup up a PPP connection and as we
are using it to do some other stuff we cannot create a PPP connection
anymore. When we are ready with the msmcomm protocol to support most of
the GSM stuff we can disable the AT port in fsogsmd and use it for
creating a PPP connection. So you see, this is no real show stopper
anymore, just a matter of time ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>What have to be done on the modem level? I assume that we currently
have about 10% disassembled from the msmcomm protocol. There are many
things missing (SIM API, Network related stuff, &hellip;). To improve this
I am currently writing a little tool called <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=msmcomm.git;a=summary">msmsh</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Suspend/Resume</strong></p>
<p>Suspend/Resume works out of the box with the kernel from webOS without
any modification. You can do a simple <em>echo mem &gt; /sys/power/state</em> and
the device suspends. To resume there are several wakeup sources defined
in the kernel (Power Button, Volume Keys, Slider, Headphone â€¦). I
already wrote a plugin for FSO's fsodeviced to support suspend/resume
within FSO.</p>
<p><strong>Touchscreen</strong></p>
<p>This is our current show stopper. Palm implemented a driver in the Linux
kernel which only does low level communication with the touchscreen. It
forwards all data from the touchscreen to the device node <em>/dev/touchscreen</em>.
Some people are trying to find out how this data is structured to use it
without requiring any of Palm's tools. But no real progress here.</p>
<p><strong>rootfs</strong></p>
<p>Currently we are building an uImage with integrated rootfs and then boot
it from our local PC on the Pre device to leave everything else on the
Pre as it is. When we are ready with basic telephony and touchscreen we
will release this uImage so everyone can test it on their device. It will
include <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=aurora.git;a=tree;f=zhone2;h=d22dc860948db78cad2210c98372009976382bb9;hb=HEAD">zhone2</a> (a rewrite of <a href="http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=zhone.git;a=summary">zhone</a> in vala) to have a simple UI
to test FSO's telephony support. Later we want to integrate a bootloader
into the device so you can easily switch between webOS and a FSO based linux.</p>
<p>So you may see, many things are already done and we're close to have a full
featured FSO framework running. If you are interested in running your Pre
without webOS and with a FOSS-only userland then get in contact with us:
