        Today, Canonical released Anbox Cloud which builds upon the same ideas as I built Anbox on in 2017. I am thankful that Canonical allowed me to take the idea of Anbox to the next level, form an engineering team around it and bring it as a fully supported product to any cloud (private or public, thanks to the magic of Juju) for a wide variety of use cases. It covers more advanced use cases like cloud gaming or application streaming for enterprises down to providing an on-premise Android cluster for development and testing of Android applications.

      <div class="content">
        Today I am making a private side-project public I am working on for more than 1.5 years now. Back in 2015 I started working on a prototype of what I call Anbox today. It was born out of the idea of putting Android into a simple container based on LXC and bridging relevant parts over to the host operating system while not allowing any access to real hardware or user data.

      <div class="content">
        Due to the last weeks and months I worked on a university project about secure communications within smart grids. As one of its results we published a paper summarizing our efforts of creating a secure communication infrastructure for it which is based on trusted computing. The paper is submitted at the german DACH Security 2013 conference.
The whole paper is in german an can be found here.

        As we released a new version of the Freesmarpthone.org middleware some time ago I am very interested in getting this into the Debian distribution and finally Ubuntu. As the various components are already available in Debian the initial packaging work is almost done and just needs to be updated to ship the recent version. As this is the first time for me with packaging something for Debian I want to share my steps to setup the packging repository here.

      <div class="content">
        Today I upgrade my server finally from Debian lenny to squeeze (which was released already last year, but I never had the time to do the upgrade since today). All in all the upgrade process went very fine. Following the release upgrade notes helped a lot and saved me some time (see 0).
Finally I migrated to a dependency based boot system too. I already started with this last year but stopped it a second time cause of missing time for it.

        After a long time I got finally supported by HP (you know they bought Palm and webOS back in 2010) with a HP Veer device for development. Back in feburary 2011 HP started a Free Pre 2 Device program and I wrote to them to get qualified for a device. After more than 8 months I finally got a device (not the Pre 2 but who cares). The HP Veer is a very tiny device I like very much.

        Talking about modem processors used in todays smartphones is a sad story. Most of them are using a binary protocol which is not known by the public. In some cases the linux userland is talking plain AT over a serial line with the modem but that's expected. Let me list some devices:
 Palm Pre/Pre Pus/Pre 2: All three have a MSM6280 modem chip and are using a binary protocol for modem access from the application processor.

        Yesterday HP released their new smartphone the HP Veer in the US to the market. At the same they released their webOS doctor for the new phone which is the ulitity you use when your device gets broken some way. It contains the whole rootfs and kernel files for the device so I was able to do some first research about the FOSS capabilities of the new device. Here are my first notes about the device and the software it's using:
